# BrawlBot-public-
If you would like a melee ranked bot for your server, simply do the following:
Fork the repository and export it to Replit (or you can use some other hosting service if you want, if it's already a 24/7 service you can delete keepalive.py, loop.py, and restart.py and the code that calls for those in Brawlbot.py)

Make an app in the discord dev portal, add it to your server, and find it's token.

Use your service's way of setting a secret variable and set your token to a secret variable that is called at the end (in place of my_secret). Change the line of code with my_secret at the top of Brawlbot.py to whatever you need it to be.

Run!

use -helpme in the server or -help to recieve information about the bot.
If you have any trouble, dm ninja1167#2527 on Discord

Note on WIFI: This was forked from the bot of the Brawl server made by APR Financing. There were two different ladders there. However, WIFI is not functional, and there is only one useable ladder. It was just left in the code in some spots.
